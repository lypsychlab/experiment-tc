        You are being asked to participate in a research study titled 
        ""Truth in Games."" You were selected to participate in 
        this project because you are an adult over age 18. This study is sponsored by 
        Boston College and the John Templeton Foundation.
    </p>
    <p style=""text-align: left;"">
        The purpose of this study is to understand how we weigh information what other people say. 
        This study will be conducted through this online survey. The survey 
        should take you XX minutes to complete. There are no direct 
        benefits to you, but you may feel gratified knowing that you helped further 
        the scholarly work in this research area, and you will be compensated $X.XX for your 
        participation. There are no costs to you associated with your participation.
    </p>
    <p style=""text-align: left;"">
        The researchers do not believe participation would entail any risks or 
        discomforts beyond those ordinarily encountered in everyday life.
    </p>
    <p style=""text-align: left;"">
        This Principal Investigator, Dr. Liane Young, will exert all reasonable efforts 
        to keep your responses and your identity confidential. We will not maintain 
        within our research data any information that uniquely identifies you, such as 
        your name, location, or Internet Protocol (IP) address. In any report we 
        publish, we will not include any information that will make it possible to 
        identify a participant. Data that includes user-ID information will be collected 
        and stored via third-party servers like Qualtrics or Pavlovia. Data collected 
        from the experiment will be coded to remove your name or any other 
        personal identifiers. All records will be secured in a locked cabinet in our lab. 
        The Institutional Review Board at Boston College and internal Boston College 
        auditors may review the research records. State or federal laws or court 
        orders may also require that information from research study records be 
        released. Otherwise, the researchers will not release to others any 
        information that could indicate your identity unless you give your permission, 
        or unless the researchers become legally required to do so.
    </p>
    <p style=""text-align: left;"">
        Although the survey will not prompt you directly to identify yourself by 
        name, email address or the like, the survey will include several demographic 
        items that would prompt you to provide certain demographic information, 
        such as your age, gender, ethnicity, education level and the like. In 
        combination, responses to such questions could suggest your identity. 
        Regardless, please know that the researchers will make no purposeful effort 
        to discern your identity based on such information. Additionally, please note 
        that you may opt to leave any such questions blank.
    </p>
    <p style=""text-align: left;"">
        Your participation is voluntary. If you choose not to participate it will not 
        affect your relations with Boston College. Some questions on the survey, 
        such as comprehension questions, may be required in order to complete the 
        survey and receive compensation. However, you may still choose to end 
        your participation in the study at any time. If you have questions or concerns 
        concerning this research you may contact the Principal Investigator at

    <strong>What was this study about?</strong>
    <br>
    In this study, we were trying to better understand how people decide what information should qualify as true or false.
    <br>
    <br>
    It's important to note that the decisions you saw from a ""previous player"" were not in fact from a previous player. 
    We chose which option was selected in each round that you observed. We also determined what the approximate amount shown in Option 2 was. 
    These approximations were not in fact determined by previous participants.
    <br>
    <br>
    We said that these two features were determined by previous participants because we're interested in how people evaluate the truth of information in real-world scenarios.
    We wanted our participants in this study to believe that they were seeing approximations that real people had created and the downstream decisions that real people made based on those approximations.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Why does it matter?</strong>
