        You are being asked to participate in a research study titled 
        ""Truth in Games."" You were selected to participate in 
        this project because you are an adult over age 18. This study is sponsored by 
        Boston College and the John Templeton Foundation.
    </p>
    <p style=""text-align: left;"">
        The purpose of this study is to understand how we weigh information what other people say. 
        This study will be conducted through this online survey. The survey 
        should take you XX minutes to complete. There are no direct 
        benefits to you, but you may feel gratified knowing that you helped further 
        the scholarly work in this research area, and you will be compensated $X.XX for your 
        participation. There are no costs to you associated with your participation.
    </p>
    <p style=""text-align: left;"">
        The researchers do not believe participation would entail any risks or 
        discomforts beyond those ordinarily encountered in everyday life.
    </p>
    <p style=""text-align: left;"">
        This Principal Investigator, Dr. Liane Young, will exert all reasonable efforts 
        to keep your responses and your identity confidential. We will not maintain 
        within our research data any information that uniquely identifies you, such as 
        your name, location, or Internet Protocol (IP) address. In any report we 
        publish, we will not include any information that will make it possible to 
        identify a participant. Data that includes user-ID information will be collected 
        and stored via third-party servers like Qualtrics or Pavlovia. Data collected 
        from the experiment will be coded to remove your name or any other 
        personal identifiers. All records will be secured in a locked cabinet in our lab. 
        The Institutional Review Board at Boston College and internal Boston College 
        auditors may review the research records. State or federal laws or court 
        orders may also require that information from research study records be 
        released. Otherwise, the researchers will not release to others any 
        information that could indicate your identity unless you give your permission, 
        or unless the researchers become legally required to do so.
    </p>
    <p style=""text-align: left;"">
        Although the survey will not prompt you directly to identify yourself by 
        name, email address or the like, the survey will include several demographic 
        items that would prompt you to provide certain demographic information, 
        such as your age, gender, ethnicity, education level and the like. In 
        combination, responses to such questions could suggest your identity. 
        Regardless, please know that the researchers will make no purposeful effort 
        to discern your identity based on such information. Additionally, please note 
        that you may opt to leave any such questions blank.
    </p>
    <p style=""text-align: left;"">
        Your participation is voluntary. If you choose not to participate it will not 
        affect your relations with Boston College. Some questions on the survey, 
        such as comprehension questions, may be required in order to complete the 
        survey and receive compensation. However, you may still choose to end 
        your participation in the study at any time. If you have questions or concerns 
        concerning this research you may contact the Principal Investigator at

    <strong>What was this study about?</strong>
    <br>
    Our research lab is broadly interested in moral psychologyâ€”that is, what motivates people to engage in prosocial and ethical behavior. 
    Below are some of the specific questions we are currently exploring:
    <ul>
        <li>What determines whether an ambiguous claim is true or false?</li>
        <li>How can we motivate people to engage in gender affirming practices?</li>
        <li>What makes people curious to know about morally bad agents</li>
        <li>How can we motivate people to act in ways that help future generations?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>Why does it matter?</strong>
    <br>
    Your participation helps us answer these questions, which in turn has implications for public figures, policy, and law. 
    For instance, our lab has collaborated with legal scholars to work to minimize the role of implicit bias in criminal justice proceedings.
    We are committed to sharing our research findings in ways that are accessible and relevant to the public.
